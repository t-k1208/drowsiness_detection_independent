## Background and Motivation
Drowsiness, sometimes called fatigue, can reduce the ability of individuals to work and lead to mental illnesses such as depression [1]. Drowsiness is recognized as one of the main factors threatening road safety [2]. From 2016 to 2018, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration reported an annual average of approximately 100,000 crashes associated with drowsy driving. Therefore, drowsiness detection is an important topic for ensuring safe driving. Being aware of individualsâ€™ drowsiness level regarding whether they are alert or sleepy is essential for productive work and quality of life. On the other hand, in driving or operating industrial machinery, a finer granularity of drowsiness detection rather than detecting drowsiness only as a binary value will be very necessary, since even mild sleepiness can lead to accidents.
